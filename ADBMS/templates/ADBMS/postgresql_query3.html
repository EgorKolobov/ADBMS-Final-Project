            <div>
                <p>Query 1 is about given the specific supplier name and the time range, we could use the supplier_id,
                    which is called sid in our table, to find the corresponding orders in the specific time range. We
                    could get the geometric information (the address where the product should be delivered) . Also, with
                    the warehouse address table (Extra Table1 we mentioned above), we could use the function like
                    ST_Distance() to measure the distance between the warehouse and the target address of each order. If
                    the ordered products are stored in multiple warehouses, we could pick up the nearest one and show it
                    to the supplier, which might help the supplier to schedule the most efficient delivery strategy.
